    mission1: "“INFORMED-Living Well” is a research project to facilitate pandemic recovery by promoting emotional wellness among Asian Americans."
    mission2: "“INFORMED” stands for “Individual and Family Oriented Responsive Messaging and Education.” The study aims to explore various approaches to build resilience and promote emotional wellness among Asian Californians in a post-pandemic world. We will investigate whether text messaging alone or text messaging combined with lay health worker outreach education can help Asian Americans get informed and learn practical skills for emotional well-being."
