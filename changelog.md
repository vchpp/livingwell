### For Google Analytics:

#### Things to measure:

- [x] Where is the visitor coming from?

What is the URL they’re hitting when they first enter the website, ie Messages/3

What is the path they take after the message?  Internal or External links followed?

How do they interact with the website (clicks, comments)

Trial participants (DT 1- 9999) Data organized by ID, with timestamp of pages visited

Track visitors based on whether DT users actually click the link with audio/downloads/like/message comments

Regular visitors total traffic from cities

What locale is used to make comments and upvotes

- [x] Overall traffic for each page

Languages being tracked

Download activity as event

Comment activity as event

Like activity as event

Audio playing as an event

External resources and Statistics events (clicks, navigation to external websites)

Track user by ID to see total pages they have visited per date
