# COVID INFORMED

This website is part of a grant awarded to UCSF by the NIH for researching COVID awareness in Asian-American communities around the San Francisco Bay Area

# Website goals
The website will be publicly accessible and will have several goals:
Disseminate up- to- date and timely information around COVID-19,  guidelines on testing and vaccination, and testing / vaccination resources facilities in multiple languages.
Collect randomized controlled trial (RCT) study participants’ engagement data through visits to the website via uniquely generated URLs sent through SMS via Mosio
Gather website usage analytics and feedback  from both RCT study participants and the community (non-participants) via visits to the website in the forms of page-view, ‘like’ ratings and comments made to specific message contents.   From the feedback, research team may improve message contents and gain understanding on views of community members of COVID-19 testing and vaccination related topics to guide future educational programs.
[tentative] Provide an opportunity to non-participant visitors to sign-up for the INFORMED text messaging program through website to get updated information about COVID-19, testing and vaccination.
[to be decided] Provide a hub of resources for Lay Health Worker to enable them to access the latest versions of the materials or information to facilitate their educational sessions/ communications with their participants.

# Website Form
The website must be mobile-first, in that all participants will be surveyed via SMS, therefore it is assumed they will be using their phones to access the website as well.

# Website Functions
The website will have several components.  Each aspect of the website will have different interactive functions depending on the user, and their mode of engagement.  Survey participants will mostly be engaged via SMS on their phones, however, will have a unique URL generated for them for direct engagement on the website.  Administrators/research team will have a back-end access to the survey data via REDCap, along with the ability to configure the survey questions, schedule message delivery,and  analyze visitor engagement.

‘Join the survey’ link would link to a redcap survey for participation


Need the redcap survey link
Intervention Message Boards

Flipcharts are for a survey participant to view after having a session with a lay-health worker
They may be tied to Weekly Intervention Messages, but not necessarily

### Resources/guidelines to external resources
A list of Federal and State resources such as guidelines, testing centers, vaccination centers, etc, best practices, etc
Testing sites
Vaccination
Stretch goal - Uses Device Location to geo route to an array of closest testing sites
MVP goal - visitor provides zip code and list all testing sites in bay area proximate to that zip

CDC is already translated to Chinese and Vietnamese , so links to their resource sites will be great

https://www.healthwise.org/ is also a potential resource website - see below


### Internationalization


Support for English, Vietnamese, Chinese (Simplified), Chinese (Traditional), Hmong
A user should be able to view the entire website in their native language


### Subscriptions
Users who are actively participating in the surveys will already have text messages delivered from Mosio survey, but should also be enrolled separately within the subscriptions of the website for updates to current
Additional users can opt-in to the Mosio study, and therefore also receive updates


External participants tracked with cookies[:rct] =7xxx
People who sign up need to be assigned a 7xxx cookie
Needs to check if the number has already been added to remove duplicates


### Administration
Admins of the website will have to actively monitor the message comments for abuse
Admins of the website will have the ability to add new, or update any messaging or text/context throughout the campaign
Ability to verify the active links are correct - use a 3rd party scanner and get a report weekly so I can update the website as necessary




Survey participants
Unique ID query string on URL sent to track movements and comments
Anticipate 1000 users


No problem to openly enroll participants
Study participants tracked with cookies[:rct]
External participants tracked with cookies[:rct] = 7xxx
Analytics
Page views, search engine optimization, traffic flows all done by Google Analytics

### HealthWise.org integration
Further Discussion regarding Healthwise cards/resources
A nested Healthwise page under Resources
Perhaps CDC page as well?

A user can view updated news
An admin can add new news events
An admin can change whether this is upcoming or past (bool)
Controller to separate out upcoming and past events
View to arrange in order of updated
Which model fields?
